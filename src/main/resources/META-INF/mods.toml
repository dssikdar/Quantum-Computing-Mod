This Minecraft Mod implements a Quantum Software world within Minecraft so that players can better understand how each
component works. There is a Qubit Block and Qubit Register Block. The Qubit Register Block can hold up to 5 qubits, one
on each face. However, the qubit must be allocated before any operation can be executed on the qubit. There are 3 gate
blocks: X (NOT), H (Hadamard), & Z (Phase Flip). There are like buttons, which means that you have to actually click
them to apply the quantum operation to the qubit. Also, to find the intermediate step of the qubit at any time, simply
use the "peak inside" item to the qubit or qubit register.

This is still a work-in-progress though!
